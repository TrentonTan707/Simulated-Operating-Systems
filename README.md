disc.c
  Implemented various Operating System's IO-scheduling algorithms in C.
  Simulated first-come-first-served, shortest-seek-time-first, and LOOK scheduling.

cpu.c
  Implemented various Operating System's CPU-scheduling algorithms in C.
  Simulated priority-based, shorted-remaining-time-next (preemptive), and round-robin scheduling.

memory.c
  Implemented various Operating System's memory-management schemes in C.
  Simulated, Best fit, first fit, next fit, and worst (largest) fit schemes as well as the method to release memory blocks.

virtual.c
  Implemented various Operating System's page-replacement algorithms in a demand-paging system in C.
  Simulated first-in-first-out, least-recently-used, and least-frequently-used page replacement policies.
